							<br/><br/>Dead without Resuscitation Efforts would be appropriate if resuscitation was initiated by non-EMS personnel but discontinued immediately upon evaluation by first arriving EMS personnel.
							<br/><br/>"Non-Acute/Routine" added for use with patients with no clinical issues-such as a refusal for a life assist-or for routine transfers. "Dead with Resuscitation Efforts (Black)" added for EMS units that arrived and provided resuscitation to a critical patient, but who was deceased at the end of the event (such as in a cardiac arrest).</v3Comment>
<v3Changes>With the release of v3.5.0 additional values were added to meet the needs of EMS.</v3Changes>
