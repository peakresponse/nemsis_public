<v3Comment>This data element should capture all of the procedures permitted by the state for any/all levels of EMS personnel in the state. This is associated with the EMS Agency State (dAgency.01). This is related to the EMS Agency's procedures (dConfiguration.07) which have been implemented within the EMS System.
										<br/><br/>State EMS systems which have regulatory authority to determine the procedures statewide may identify ICD-10 PCS procedure codes based on medical direction and their own need.
										<br/>
										<br/>Code list is represented in ICD-10-PCS: Procedure Codes, see suggested NEMSIS list of procedure codes.

										<br/><br/>The EMS agency should submit “Not Applicable” and “Nil” to the state system for the demographic export.  The state EMS system does not need to import this information into their database.  It is the responsibility of the state to submit this element to the national EMS database (NEMSIS).  Reference the Demographic Dataset Submission Guide for further details.</v3Comment>
